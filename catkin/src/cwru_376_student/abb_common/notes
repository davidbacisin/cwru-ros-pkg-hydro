managed to launch irb120 model w/ launch file here.

HOWEVER, arm is severed btwn links 3 and 4 in Gazebo model!!

need to fix this. 

also, rosrun abb_pub_base abb_pub_base to force the robot-arm base to a fixed pose on the ground plane.
(included this node in the launch file) 

robot launches OK in Gazebo, then the links fall apart!  (more links are dying)
